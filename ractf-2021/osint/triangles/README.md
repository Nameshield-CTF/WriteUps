## Solution
We need to find the location of the image. First thing I tried was to do reverse image search on google. I found this website : http://notizie.comuni-italiani.it/foto/61298.
I translated the italian text and it says "Once the project was completed, this week there was the opportunity to view the photos in the exhibition inside the Cosentini building in Ragusa Ibla", so I looked for the Cosentini buidling and I found the location : https://www.google.com/maps/@36.9266286,14.7367835,3a,75y,339.15h,98.89t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s74kfoJ1Npr2eCY2_jG8zkQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3D74kfoJ1Npr2eCY2_jG8zkQ%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D355.17206%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192
