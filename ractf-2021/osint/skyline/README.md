## Solution
As the first one, the first thing I did was to reverse search the image. But this time, I didn't found anything intersting because a sky view is not really precise.
So I tried to focus on recognizable point. I cut the three building part and did a research on this.

This is some building in Greenwich around the Tamise and it fitted perfectly. And looking at the google view, I saw that their was a cable car above the Tamise. I just needed to find exacly where the photo was taken, but after some tries, I found It.
