## Solution
Their was a sign in the middle of the picture, I used the text to determine were the picture is. It was in portugal.

We could also see another sign on the bottom of the picture, it said "Bistro24", so I looked for Bistro 24 in Portugal and I found it : https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bistro+24/@37.1022262,-8.365757,17.83z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x9a5bc2fcb670d042!8m2!3d37.1028445!4d-8.3645238
