## Solution
The difficulty here is that the text are blured. At first, I looked for the "Nova" sign because I thought it was the store Fashio Nova. But it seemed that it was not the right logo.

So I want for the "Cenato" sign. I was not sure about the name, but et seemed that it was a restaurant, so I look for "restaurant cenato" and i found the logo : https://www.google.com/search?q=restaurant+cenato&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiRyu7_qbDyAhUP4RoKHd4XBgEQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=restaurant+cenato&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoICAAQCBAHEB5QmfMFWPmVBmDylwZoAXAAeACAAU-IAasFkgECMTGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=Fp4XYZHnIY_Ca96vmAg&bih=927&biw=1920&client=firefox-b-d#imgrc=99w_kJc18I6u9M

So the text at the top of the sign is "Hai". I search for the full name and I found a restaurant that was at the "Nova Building" and their is the answer.
