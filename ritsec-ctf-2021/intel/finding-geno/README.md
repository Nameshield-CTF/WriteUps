## Description
We know that our missing personâ€™s name is Geno and that he works for a local firm called Bridgewater. What is his last name? (Wrap the answer in RS{})

## Solution
It was really an easy one. I had his first name and his company's name, so I went on Linkedin and search for "geno bridgewater" and found him : https://www.linkedin.com/in/geno-ikonomov/
So the flag his RS{ikonomov}
