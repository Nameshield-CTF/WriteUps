# Identifying an Attack

By [Siorde](https://github.com/Siorde)

## Description
Thehackerscrew are remotely executing arbitrary code through Appleâ€™s bluetooth. Can you identify the CVE of the attack?

The CVE should be wrapped around RTL{}

## Solution
There are not a lot to explain for this one. I just searched (for quite a long time) for Apple's CVE on bluetooth with remote execution. And I got here : https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146 and the right one was CVE-2021-1794.
