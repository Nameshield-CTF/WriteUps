## Solution
We have the encrypted flag, so i need to understand how the crypting work to find the flag. From how it look, it seems logical that we only need to replace each letter with the right one.<br/>
The first part of the flag should be "shaktictf", so from that i tried to shift every letter for the right one. I found : <br/>
o-22=s <br/>
v-14=h <br/>
m-12=a <br/>
o-4=k <br/>
g-13=t <br/>
e-22=i <br/>
q-14=c <br/>
f-12=t <br/>
j-4=f <br/>
From that i got a pattern, so i continue to shift the unknown letter following the shift and i got the flag : shaktictf{lets_start_with_something_classical!}
