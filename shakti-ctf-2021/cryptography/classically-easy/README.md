## Solution
We have the encrypted flag, so i need to understand how the crypting work to find the flag. From how it look, it seems logical that we only need to replace each letter with the right one.
The first part of the flag should be "shaktictf", so from that i tried to shift every letter for the right one. I found : 
o-22=s
v-14=h
m-12=a
o-4=k
g-13=t
e-22=i
q-14=c
f-12=t
j-4=f
From that i got a pattern, so i continue to shift the unknown letter following the shift and i got the flag : shaktictf{lets_start_with_something_classical!}
