# Just A Comment

## Description
Just a comment, we love our people here at ClearEdge!

## Solution
We have a PCAP and we need to find the flag in it. The hint we have is that it is a "comment".</br>
This one is easy, but you need to know it, otherwise you can look for it for a while.</br>
PCAP file can be commented. If you open the file with Wireshark, you can see at the bottom right : "Comments: 1", so the file is commented.
To see it, you can display the file properties with CTRL+ALT+MAJ+C or directly in the menu Statistics.
And their you get the flag : DawgCTF{w3 h34r7 0ur 1r4d 734m}.
